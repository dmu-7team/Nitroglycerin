The project comes for Unity 2022.3.57f1 but will also work in other (later) versions.
Before you can start using & modifying the kit, you will need to set the project up for the first time.
Firstly, import the Mirror package from the asset store: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/mirror-129321
Then, you need to connect the project with a Unity Project ID.
You can find this in Edit/Project Settings/Services. You can either create a new Project ID here, or link it to an existing project.
After you’ve done so, open the Unity Dashboard (https://cloud.unity.com). Make sure you’re logged in with the correct account.
In the dashboard, select your project and activate the Lobby, Player Authentication and Relay services. Once those are activated, your project should be ready and work online!
